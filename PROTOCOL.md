# The XMTP Protocol

This document focuses on describing the current version of the Extensible Message Transport Protocol: XMTP V2.

To learn about the previous version of the protocol, see [V1](#V1).

## Intro

The protocol allows `clients`, representing identities associated with blockchain accounts (further 'accounts'), to communicate securely with each other. The communications are represented as `conversations` between two or more clients. A conversation consists of a sequence of `messages` from a `sender` to the other `participants` of the conversation, the `recipients`.

The communication is mediated by a network of `nodes`. The network is responsible for ensuring that messages are delivered between clients. Since clients are not necessarily connected to the network at the same time, the network must be able to store messages while they are in transit.

The protocol is layered to satisfy various operational and security requirements. For example, the clients are responsible for all the encryption and authentication, and key management. The nodes see only encrypted user-generated content with no indication of identities involved.

## Network Layer

Messages are opaque to the node (encrypted), i.e. nodes do not read/interpret the contents of the messages. Unencrypted message headers are readable and can be processed by the nodes.

Consequently, a message is just an opaque `payload` to the nodes, wrapped in an `envelope` before being passed to the network by the clients. Besides the payload, an envelope also carries a `timestamp` and `topic`.

Envelopes are always associated with a `topic`. Topics are used to group related envelopes. A topic is a required parameter of all interactions with the network layer, e.g. "add this envelope to this topic", "give me all envelopes from this topic with timestamp between X and Y", or "send me all new envelopes for this topic".

Nodes employ the [Waku relay protocol](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/11/) to propagate envelopes through the network and the [Waku store protocol](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/13/) to make envelopes persist.

## Client Layer

Clients connect to an arbitrary node through a GRPC-based [message API](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_api/v1/message_api.proto) and interact with the network as a whole through this node. The message API is the interface separating the client layer from the network layer. Conversations are represented at the network layer as topics.

The client layer uses protobuf for encoding of all its structures. The definitions are maintained in the [xmtp/proto repository](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto).

### Keys

A client is associated with a blockchain account through a set of public/private keys (EC secp256k1) generated when the account is registered with the XMTP network. First there is the identity key that serves as a proxy for the account key and is signed by the account key to establish its authenticity. Then there are one or more pre-keys that are used for payload encryption and signing. The pre-keys are signed by the identity key to prove authenticity. The two-level key structure is there to facilitate more frequent key rotation without requiring frequent account key signing. The key structure and naming are modeled after [Signal's X3DH protocol](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/#the-x3dh-protocol).

The keys are maintained and stored together in a key bundle, the private keys in a [EncryptedPrivateKeyBundle](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/private_key.proto) and public keys in a [SignedPublicKeyBundle](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/public_key.proto).

### Contacts

To start a conversation, the initiator needs the public keys of the participants. To facilitate this step, registered clients publish their public key bundle in easily discoverable contact topics.

Each blockchain account is automatically assigned a contact topic named `contact-<account address>`. Public key bundles are published as [ContactBundles](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/contact.proto) which allow for versioning of the bundle format. The encoded `ContactBundle` is the payload of an envelope published into the contact topic.

A public key bundle MUST be republished whenever the pre-key or identity-key changes. The latest published bundle represents the current bundle that should be used for all new messages and conversations.

Only account owners SHOULD be able to publish into their contact topics. This could be enforced at the API or at the node level. Specifics are out of scope in this document.

### Invitations

A conversation is initiated by a client sending an [Invitation](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/invitation.proto) to one or more participants. The invitation contains a randomly generated name of the topic to be used for the conversation messages, and randomly generated secret key material to be used for message encryption. It also indicates the encryption algorithm to use for message encryption.

Invitations are published into invite topics. Each blockchain account is automatically assigned an invite topic named `invite-<account address>`. It contains all the invitations both sent and received by the account owner. It allows the client to reconstruct the list of all past conversations and to find their corresponding message topics.

Invitations are encrypted using a key derived from the pre-keys of the invitation sender and recipient. Consequently, the sender and the recipient of an invitation are present in the header, outside of the encrypted payload, and visible to outside observers (i.e. nodes). The encoded [`SealedInvitation`](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/invitation.proto) is the payload of an envelope published into an invite topic.

### Messages

[Messages](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/xmtp_envelope.proto) are published into conversation topics indicated by the corresponding invitation. Conversation topic names follow the format `m-<base64 encoded random 32bytes>`.

Message content is encoded using a content type framework represented by the [EncodedContent type](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/xmtp_envelope.proto). Usage of the content type framework is governed by [XIP-5](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-5-message-content-types.md).

The bytes of the `EncodedContent` are wrapped in [SignedContent](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/xmtp_envelope.proto), signed using the pre-key of the sender. The signature covers the bytes of the `EncodedContent` and the bytes of the [MessageHeaderV2](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/xmtp_envelope.proto) to frustrate replay attacks. `SignedContent` is then encrypted using the key material from the invitation and wrapped in [Ciphertext](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/ciphertext.proto). Finally [MessageV2](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/xmtp_envelope.proto) combines the `Ciphertext` and the bytes of the message header. The encoded `MessageV2` is the payload of an envelope published into a conversation topic.

## V1

Previous version of the protocol (further V1) had the differences described below.

The XMTP network supports both versions of the protocol to allow for correct retrieval of historical conversations. V1 conversations can still receive new messages if the parties initiated them before the V2 protocol rollout.

### Keys

The protocol used a different format for keys and key bundles, see [PublicKeyBundle](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/proto/message_contents/public_key.proto), although semantically there was very little difference. The old format had optional public key signatures, although this was never actually the case because the signatures were effectively required.

### Introductions

The protocol didn't use Invitations, instead it used introduction topics named `intro-<account address>`. When a sender wanted to initiate a conversation with a recipient, the client would send the first message to 3 different topics: the sender's intro topic, the recipient's intro topic, and the shared conversation topic (see below). This allowed using the intro topics to reconstruct one's list of pre-existing conversations.

### Messages

Conversation topics were deterministically named `dm-<account address 1>-<account address 2>` with the two addresses sorted deterministically as well. Consequently, there could only be one conversation between two accounts, with all messages between these two accounts stored in a single topic. This structure also allows only one-to-one conversations. V1 conversations do not have IDs or metadata.

The messages were encrypted using a key derived from the pre-keys of the sender and recipient, a scheme that is identical to the one used for Invitations above. Consequently, the sender and the recipient of a message were present in the header, outside of the encrypted payload, and visible to outside observers (i.e. nodes).
