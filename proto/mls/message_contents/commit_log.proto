/**
   PLAINTEXT COMMIT LOG ENTRY
   PlaintextCommitLogEntry indicates whether a commit was successful or not,
   when applied on top of the indicated `last_epoch_authenticator`.

   Commit hashes are defined as the Keccak256 hash of the 'data' field of the
   GroupMessageInput protobuf (which is the serialized MlsProtocolMessage).

   Epoch authenticators identify the encryption state for the epoch after the
   commit was applied, and are defined in the MLS spec.

   CLIENT PROCESSING ALGORITHM
   Clients must start from the beginning of the commit log, and process entries
   sequentially to determine the authoritative state after each commit is
   applied.

   Each entry is processed as follows:
   1. If the `last_epoch_authenticator` does not match the `epoch_authenticator`
      of the most recent successful commit, the entry is ignored and the next
      entry is processed.
   2. If the `result` is any value other than COMMIT_RESULT_SUCCESS, then the
      commit_hash is recorded as failed.
   3. Otherwise, the commit_hash is marked as successful and the
      `epoch_authenticator` is recorded as the next valid state.
